## Installation

Download [the latest release EXE](https://github.com/isovel/HookLineSinker/releases) and run it, simple as that! You'll need to go through the setup process once. Do not download the source code unless you know what you're doing.

## Troubleshooting/tips

- Do not download Hook, Line, & Sinker from the "Code" button at the top.
- If you run into any issues, try running the program as administrator.
- You may need to install [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) manually, I've tried to make it automatic but it's not perfect.
